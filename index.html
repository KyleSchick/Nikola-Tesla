      <p>Inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He contributed to the development of the alternating-current electrical
        system that's widely used today and discovered the rotating magnetic field (the basis of most AC machinery). He sold several patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse. Tesla died in New York City on January 7,
        1943.
